## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, muted gold (#C4B397), inspired by high-end architectural materials; provides sophistication and visual interest.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5F5) with 20% saturation; creates a subtle, refined backdrop that enhances readability and visual calm.
- Accent color: Subtle, desaturated rusty brown (#9A4214), analogous to the primary color but offering enough contrast to highlight interactive elements without overwhelming the user.
- Body text: 'Inter', sans-serif.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', humanist sans-serif.
- Minimalist Icons: Sharp, geometric icons to reflect architectural precision. Line thickness should be uniform to maintain a clean aesthetic.
- Grid-Based Layout: Use a strict grid system for a sense of order. White space is essential for separating elements and highlighting content effectively.
- Subtle Transitions: Employ subtle animations and transitions for enhanced engagement without distraction. Scroll-based animations should progressively load content.
